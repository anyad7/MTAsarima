SARIMA model on quarterly MTA subway ridership

this project uses quarterly MTA subway ridership compiled from the travel patterns report issued by NYMTC. I wanted to learn more about time series forcasting and used SARIMA on 2016-2018 MTA subway ridership. I used juypter notebook, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib in addition to different tests and models from statsmodels and sklearn.
